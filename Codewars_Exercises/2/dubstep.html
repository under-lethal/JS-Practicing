		Let's assume that a song consist of some number of words(that didn't contain WUB).
		To make the dubstep remix of this song, Polycarpus inserts a certain number of words "WUB" before the first word of the song (the number may be zero), 
		after the last word (the number may be zero), 
		and between words(at least one between any pair of neighbouring words), 
		and then the boy glues together all the words including "WUB", in one string and plays the song at the club.

		1. We have to remove the "WUB'S" between the words. (string manipulation)
		2. TO do "string manipulation" we can either use "REGULAR EXPRESSION" <mark>(A regular expression is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern. The search pattern can be used for text search and text replace operations.)</mark>
		or we can simply find "WOBs" an REMOVE them - and then <b>we need to put a space between for each WUB</b>. <mark>string.replace</mark>
		3. replace every "WOB" with a "SPACE". <mark>string.replace('WUB', ' ')</mark>
